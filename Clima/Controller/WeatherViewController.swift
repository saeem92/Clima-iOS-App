        // The idea is that the Textfield can communicate what's going on and the way we ensure that the view controllers notified by the text field is by setting the ViewController as Delegate

        // The UItextField class is actually the one that's responsible for calling these function/methods and when it calls textFieldShouldEndEditing basically when it detects user dismissing the keyboard, IN THAT MOMENT IT'S GONNA PASS A REFERENCE TO THE textField that triggered this method.
        
        // We could for example have a multiple textfield similat to how in our IBAciton we can get hold of the sender which was the UIButton that actually triggered this IBAction by detecting a touchevent.
        
        // We can have multiple textfield or triggering the same methods so if we had multiple buttons linked to the same IBAction then any of those buttons could be the sender it just depends on who detected the event.
        
        // IF WE HAVE MULTIPLE textFields ALL WITH THEIR DELEGATES SET AS THIS CURRENT CLASS ANY OF THOSE textFields COULD BE THE TRIGGER FOR THOSE DELEGATE METHODS BUT THEY WILL PASS THEIR IDENTITY IN THROUGH THIS TextField parameter so if we dont care about which textfield was triggered then we can simply use this parameter (_ textField: UITextField) and apply our validation to any textField in our currentViewController using this code

    }
    // In the above function we are checking if user hasn't typed anything we will display him a placeholder saying type something if the user has typed something then it will work normally keyboard will dissppear and we will get our desired result.
    // The above function gets to decide what to do when the user clicked on go or return without typing in the search field.

        }
    } // As this is an optional string I am passing over to my WeatherManager a definite string instead of an optional string so I am using "if let" to optionally unwrap
    // The above function is used to stop editing and clear the search when we have finsished editing or entering a city name and when we hit search or go it's gonna clear the search label so that we can enter a new city name next time.
